# Traceability & Dimensions Core Developer Guide

Document lineage, correlation IDs, upstream/downstream references, reconciliation surfaces, and common operating dimensions for cross-plugin traceability.

**Maturity Tier:** `Hardened`

## Purpose And Architecture Role

Defines document lineage, common dimensions, and reconciliation surfaces so cross-plugin business effects stay visible and repairable.

### This plugin is the right fit when

- You need **lineage graph**, **common dimensions**, **reconciliation queues** as a governed domain boundary.
- You want to integrate through declared actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and UI surfaces instead of implicit side effects.
- You need the host application to keep plugin boundaries honest through manifest capabilities, permissions, and verification lanes.

### This plugin is intentionally not

- Not a full vertical application suite; this plugin only owns the domain slice exported in this repo.
- Not a replacement for explicit orchestration in jobs/workflows when multi-step automation is required.

## Hooks, Events, And Orchestration

This plugin should be integrated through **explicit commands/actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and the surrounding Gutu event runtime**. It must **not** be documented as a generic WordPress-style hook system unless such a hook API is explicitly exported.

- No standalone plugin-owned lifecycle event feed is exported today.
- Job surface: `traceability.projections.refresh`, `traceability.reconciliation.run`.
- Workflow surface: `traceability-reconciliation`.
- Recommended composition pattern: invoke actions, read resources, then let the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime handle downstream automation.

## Storage, Schema, And Migration Notes

- Database compatibility: `postgres`, `sqlite`
- Schema file: `framework/builtin-plugins/traceability-core/db/schema.ts`
- SQL helper file: `framework/builtin-plugins/traceability-core/src/postgres.ts`
- Migration lane present: Yes

The plugin ships explicit SQL helper exports. Use those helpers as the truth source for database migration or rollback expectations.

## Failure Modes And Recovery

- Action inputs can fail schema validation or permission evaluation before any durable mutation happens.
- If downstream automation is needed, the host must add it explicitly instead of assuming this plugin emits jobs.
- There is no separate lifecycle-event feed to rely on today; do not build one implicitly from internal details.
- Schema regressions are expected to show up in the migration lane and should block shipment.

## Mermaid Flows

### Primary Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  caller["Host or operator"] --> action["traceability.links.record"]
  action --> validation["Schema + permission guard"]
  validation --> service["Traceability & Dimensions Core service layer"]
  service --> state["traceability.links"]
  service --> jobs["Follow-up jobs / queue definitions"]
  service --> workflows["Workflow state transitions"]
  state --> ui["Admin contributions"]
```

### Workflow State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> draft
  draft --> pending_approval
  draft --> active
  draft --> reconciled
  draft --> closed
  draft --> canceled
```


## Integration Recipes

### 1. Host wiring

```ts
import { manifest, recordTraceabilityLinkAction, BusinessPrimaryResource, jobDefinitions, workflowDefinitions, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/traceability-core";

export const pluginSurface = {
  manifest,
  recordTraceabilityLinkAction,
  BusinessPrimaryResource,
  jobDefinitions,
  workflowDefinitions,
  adminContributions,
  uiSurface
};
```

Use this pattern when your host needs to register the plugin’s declared exports without reaching into internal file paths.

### 2. Action-first orchestration

```ts
import { manifest, recordTraceabilityLinkAction } from "@plugins/traceability-core";

console.log("plugin", manifest.id);
console.log("action", recordTraceabilityLinkAction.id);
```

- Prefer action IDs as the stable integration boundary.
- Respect the declared permission, idempotency, and audit metadata instead of bypassing the service layer.
- Treat resource IDs as the read-model boundary for downstream consumers.

### 3. Cross-plugin composition

- Register the workflow definitions with the host runtime instead of re-encoding state transitions outside the plugin.
- Drive follow-up automation from explicit workflow transitions and resource reads.
- Pair workflow decisions with notifications or jobs in the outer orchestration layer when humans must be kept in the loop.

## Current Truth And Recommended Next

### Current truth

- Exports 7 governed actions: `traceability.links.record`, `traceability.dimensions.publish`, `traceability.reconciliation.queue`, `traceability.links.hold`, `traceability.links.release`, `traceability.links.amend`, `traceability.links.reverse`.
- Owns 3 resource contracts: `traceability.links`, `traceability.dimensions`, `traceability.reconciliation`.
- Publishes 2 job definitions with explicit queue and retry policy metadata.
- Publishes 1 workflow definition with state-machine descriptions and mandatory steps.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Ships explicit SQL migration or rollback helpers alongside the domain model.
- Documents 5 owned entity surface(s): `Document Link`, `Traceability Dimension`, `Lineage Snapshot`, `Reconciliation Surface`, `Correlation Graph`.
- Carries 4 report surface(s) and 3 exception queue(s) for operator parity and reconciliation visibility.
- Tracks ERPNext reference parity against module(s): `Stock`, `Accounts`, `Selling`, `Buying`, `Support`.
- Operational scenario matrix includes `lead-to-cash-lineage`, `procure-to-pay-lineage`, `plan-to-produce-genealogy`.
- Governs 3 settings or policy surface(s) for operator control and rollout safety.

### Current gaps

- No extra gaps were discovered beyond the plugin’s declared boundaries.

### Recommended next

- Deepen drift detection and exception routing as more business plugins emit downstream linked work.
- Expose stronger operator tooling for process lineage and partial-failure recovery.
- Broaden lifecycle coverage with deeper orchestration, reconciliation, and operator tooling where the business flow requires it.
- Add more explicit domain events or follow-up job surfaces when downstream systems need tighter coupling.
- Convert more ERP parity references into first-class runtime handlers where needed, starting from `Serial No`, `Batch`, `Stock Ledger Entry`.

### Later / optional

- Outbound connectors, richer analytics, or portal-facing experiences once the core domain contracts harden.
